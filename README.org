* Introduction

This is a simple package to search through common sites from within
Emacs using the natvie browser *eww*.

* Usage

Call the interactive function ~qs-do-search~ which takes in two
inputs:
+ the search string (or the region if active)
+ single letter website code (see quick-search.el)

It uses standard Google search with the extra keyword ~site:<special
site>~ appended. It opens it in a side window with *eww*.

You could also specify an external browser by setting the variable
~qs-browser~ to the exteral browser command. It will just call this
through ~shell-command~ and append the URL generated.

* Installation 

Please copy the file ~quick_search.el~ and load it in your init file.
